This Flask app listens for a user input and when they stop typing, it erases their typed content.
To use the app, simply open a web browser and navigate to https://disappearing-text.onrender.com/. You should see a text box
where you can type. As you type, the app will listen for your input. When you stop typing for 3 seconds, the app will erase your typed content.
